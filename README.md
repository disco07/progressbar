# progressbar
A simple progress bar for golang projects. I created that because there was a long processus in some projet and I didn't know what was the progression.


## Installation
```golang
go get -u github.com/disco07/progressbar
```

## Usage
### Basic usage
```golang
bar := progressbar.Default(100)
for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
    bar.Add(1)
    time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
}
```
